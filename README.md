I was one of those kids who couldn't tell with confidence what they wanted to become when grow up. My answer hit me in my early teens, when I got finished my first web page, developed for Netscape. I felt mighty. I made something out of my hands that was digital and it had value for me back then.

Being in the university I had a great time learning all about graphic designs and digital interfaces. I’ve earned extensive knowledge of visual arts and gained an eye for beautiful things.

More than 8 years now, I’ve been professionally involved in building web user interfaces and using contemporary client-side technologies. And my interest increases with every new released UI technology.

As said, by connecting the dots now I realize that getting satisfaction from creating beautiful and friendly web UIs wouldn’t be that powerful if it weren’t for all those design things I’ve learned back in the years.
